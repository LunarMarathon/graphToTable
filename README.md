You must have seen graphs or networks(or even mindmaps), connecting words or sentences. But with our screens being too small, we can only view a certain amount of nodes even when zoomed out to a certain extent. This project is to see if all the space between the nodes can be utilized in a better manner by viewing the same data in a table. Why is there a need to squeeze the nodes into a boring table? To have enough text on the screen for one to stumble upon new insights or to find new connections between two different topics. It's an experiment to test after using Obsidian's graphs for a while.
